# Mapping Earthquakes
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to develop an interactive map using Leaflet do display the global Earthquake date from the previous week. These data are displayed as two layers: all earthquakes from the past 7 days and all of the earthquakes from the past seven days of magnitude 4.5 and greater. In addition to the earthquake layers, the tectonic plate boundaries are also loaded as a layer. Users can toggle these three layers to explore the data as well as choose from 4 different tile layers of street map, light map, dark map, and satellite views.
